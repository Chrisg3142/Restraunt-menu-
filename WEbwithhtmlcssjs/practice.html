            <article>
                <p>We are a family owned restraunt chain, we currently have three <a href="#locations">Locations</a> based in Flushing, Corona, and Brooklyn. We opened our first shop in 2005 and we were in a small building until 2010 where we opened our first big restraunt in Corona. We kept all our menus open to suggetions and recieved a lot of feedback from customers. We kept this style and managed to save enough money to open our second restraunt in flushing in 2013 and opened our third restraunt recently in 2022 located in Brooklyn. We started our restraunts due to high demand from our family and friends for our cooking and they said that people should pay to eat this food and that is where our business began. We made it this far due to support from everyone in our community and around the neighborhoods that we have our restraunts in, aswell as the people that take the time out of their day to come and eat at our restraunts and for that we thank you!!! We strive to maintain a clean and haelthy enviorment, making sure everyone does there part in keeping the restraunts clean and ready for customers to walk in at any time. We also maintain our customer service with only the best so your next visit will be smooth and easy so there will be nmo issues with your order. We are The New Yorker, we hope that you come and try our food and hoepfully it leaves you full and wanting to come back! We will be waiting for your visit!</p>

            <p>The food was amazing I wish this website can track stars because I would give it so many but it seems like the person coding hasn't solved that issue and may return to it some other day somewhere in the future. I like how easy it was to order but this website needs work maybe some practice and boom the coder will have it looking like a top website like google or youtube.</p>

            <p>This food was awesome and I am glad to support a family business since I went to their location in corona and the staff was very nice and they seemed busy but still took some time to talk to me about the area and about the menu and helped me come to a decision on what to eat. It was amazing.</p>
